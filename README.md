# scrapy-google-flights
This is a small project demonstrating how one could scrape flight data from Google Flights using scrapy and pyppeteer.
Currently only oneway flights are supported.

## requirements
To run this spider, you will need to install [pyppeteer](https://pypi.org/project/pyppeteer/), [scrapy-poet](https://pypi.org/project/scrapy-poet/) and [spidermon](https://pypi.org/project/spidermon/).

## starting the spider
After cloning and installing the necessary requirements, you should be able to start the spider with the command `scrapy crawl google_flights`. 
You can see more options for running the spider with `scrapy crawl --help`.

## changing the flight searches
The searches performed by the spider are performed in the file `searches.json`. This file can be found in the folder `scrapy_google_flights/resources/`.
The format looks like this:
```json
{
    "origin": "airport from which you start",
    "destination": "airport at which you arrive",
    "days_to_depart": days until start of flight
}
```

`origin` and `destination` are specified as [IATA airport codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA_airport_code). `days_to_depart` is an integer which defines in how many days from now the flight starts.
For example, if you wanted to travel from "Berlin Brandenburg Airport" (BER) to "Barcelonaâ€“El Prat Airport" (BCN) in 30 days, your json would look like this:

```json
{
    "origin": "BER",
    "destination": "BCN",
    "days_to_depart": 30
}
```

## enable Spidermon notifications via Telegram
You can get notifications when the Spider starts and finishes via Telegram. 
To enable these notifications, you need to create a Telegram bot and obtain your api access token. 
A decent guide on how to do that can be found [here](https://www.siteguarding.com/en/how-to-get-telegram-bot-api-token).
After creating your bot, you can add and message it via Telegram. Then, you could replace <BOT_TOKEN_HERE> with your token and get the chat id here: `https://api.telegram.org/bot<BOT_TOKEN_HERE>/getUpdates`.

You can then set the following values in `settings.py`:
```python
SPIDERMON_TELEGRAM_SENDER_TOKEN = 'your api access token'
SPIDERMON_TELEGRAM_RECIPIENTS = ['chat id']
```
